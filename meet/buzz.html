			<h1>Wicket Buzz</h1>
			<p>Wicket has appeared in the press in a variety of industry trade magazines,
including Network World, ComputerWorld, IT World and Information Week.
Presentations on Wicket have been delivered by Wicket team members at JavaOne
in San Francisco, Javapolis and TheServerSide Java Symposium in Europe. The
following are quotes from reviewers and users of Wicket:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After working with JSF for almost a year, trying Wicket was like that
movie scene where the clouds part and this big ray of light hits you
in the face. I just had this feeling while JSF’ing that certain things
were harder than they needed to be. Well, I was right, and the Wicket
people figured it out.</p>

  <p><a href="http://bigheadco.blogspot.com/2007/03/groovy-wicket.html">Kevin Galligan</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wicket (currently undergoing incubation with Apache) is a good
example of a web framework which throws caution to the wind, and has
absolutely no XML needed. We here at Mystic have a lot of love for
Wicket and are actively developing several projects with it currently.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com/blog/2007/03/13/the-rise-of-the-xml-backlash/">Mystic Coders</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing a Wicket app is rather more like writing an event-based
desktop application than a web application.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.lshift.net/blog/2006/07/06/wicket">LShift</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wickedly Cool” - I actually managed to whip together a Wicket
Application in a few days. It is entertaining to work with, adding
shiny stuff is really easy while you can develop Java code and keep
those last bits of hair you have saved for ripping out in a CSS
nightmare that you hopefully after finding Wicket will not have to
deal with.  So I’d go out on a limb and say that Wicket == Rogaine for
developers.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So is Wicket the one true MVC framework that a lot of us have been
hunting for? At the moment, I tend to think so. […] If you like Java
you will really like Wicket.”</p>

  <p><a href="http://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2007/03/02/wicket-impressions-moving-from-spring-mvc-webflow/">Peter Thomas</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think its an awesome way to deal with this whole web UI framework
mess. I am happy to see someone take a simple and clean approach to
the whole problem, and come up with a transparent POJO solution. I
like the direction the framework is going… Wicket is clean, simple
and elegant.”</p>

  <p>Comment on TheServerSide.com</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Last week I wrote an article about Wicket and I spent some time
discovering and taming it. And I have to confess this: I love it. …
snip … Wicket is not a framework, it’s a candy bar. And everybody
loves candy bars…”</p>

  <p>Comment made by Romain Guy</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The issue that impressed me in the Wicket model is that “Wicket does
not mix markup with Java code and adds no special syntax to your
markup files.” You reference Wicket identities as HTML attributes
and define component properties in Java, which allows designers and
programmers to work independently (within the obvious constraint of
having common goals). There is no need for special tools.</p>

  <p>From a Network World editorial entitled “Nothing Sticky about Wicket”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a recent blog post I asked for feedback on what Web frameworks
folks are using. Well, I got quite a surprise: Wicket was the most
often recommended framework in reader emails!</p>

  <p>From an About.com article entitled And the Winner is…Wicket</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have used Wicket since last Fall for personal projects. I have 3
kids and a wife so my free-time is very limited. Given that, I had to
be very picky about which framework I chose.  I’ve been very impressed
with how little hassle it has been to start creating powerful,
reusable components and pages with Wicket even under rather severe
time constraints.”</p>

  <p>Comment on TheServerSide.com</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>”…after using web MVC frameworks for a couple of years, building
ever more complex web applications, I moved to component based
frameworks. Of these, I think Wicket is by far the best…”</p>

  <p>Comment on Manageability.org</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>”… Talk about a mind blowing experience, it literally took me ten
minutes to have a sample application up and running! The Wicket API is
very Swing like, which was a welcome change for me, and allowed for a
very familiar development experience. There is even an extension that
allows for direct use of a Swing TreeModel. There are so many things
that I like about this framework …”</p>

  <p>From a blog item by the Code Poet</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wicket has a learning flat.”</p>

  <p>Al Maw</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JSF is Cool and young but Wicket is younger and even cooler. Have
you tried wicket?. I am also building a large CRUD application for
Job Exchange System in my country using Wicket + JPA + Stateless
EJB3 + Glassfish (the latest promoted build of glassfish) and we are
currently in testing phase and I am not having any serious headaches
as things seems to be under control. All our forms are Ajax. We have
several concurrent accesses and system is stable. I believe greatly in
the Wicket Project especially for CRUD cases.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“focuses the development efforts in the right place, inside plain Java
code” !! This was the winning ticket for me. The framework is truly
amazing. I used ever dang framework in the book and can say that I’m
most impressed with this one.</p>

  <p>Shocking simplicity. Back to the roots. Thanks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wicket as far as I am concerned is the way forward for web development
in Java. A lot of creativity involved though especially with the loops
but It makes Web Development so much fun.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wicket became my favorite framework in about a 24-hour period, and
I think it has a very bright future. With most frameworks I see
limitations, with Wicket I see possibilities. There’s your platitude
for the day :)”</p>

  <p>wicket-user mailing list</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Count me in… I’ve only been using Wicket for maybe 2 weeks or so,
and I’m sold.”</p>

  <p>Phillip Rhodes </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once I grasped the essence of Wicket, everything just started working
so well. Damn you, Wicket, I said under my breath. I was really
disappointed that I liked it so much. Damn you Wicket! Suddenly I
loved all those Wicket developers, because I understood what they
were trying to say. Web development can be simple, yet have unlimited
power.</p>

  <p>Closet Wicket lover</p>
